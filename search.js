( 19mm and 21 mm have to be tapered to 18mm and 20mm respectively)\n\nplease feel free to email me about questions or custom orders.","creation_tsz":1476467829,"ending_tsz":1487098629,"original_creation_tsz":1443703672,"last_modified_tsz":1476467829,"price":"120.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":3,"tags":["horween","shell","cordovan","watch","strap","whiskey","18mm","19mm","20mm","21mm","22mm","custom","band"],"category_path":["Accessories","Watch"],"category_path_ids":[69150467,69153693],"materials":["horween shell cordovan"],"shop_section_id":null,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1473423982,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/250140999\/horween-bourbon-colour-shell-cordovan?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":1059,"num_favorers":12,"shipping_template_id":null,"processing_min":5,"processing_max":10,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"made_to_order","item_weight":null,"item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":false,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":true,"taxonomy_id":6077,"taxonomy_path":["Jewelry","Watches","Watch Bands & Straps"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":1088541381,"hex_code":"816B5D","red":129,"green":107,"blue":93,"hue":23,"saturation":27,"brightness":50,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1473681452,"listing_id":250140999,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/111\/0\/10334224\/il_75x75.1088541381_li3w.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/111\/0\/10334224\/il_170x135.1088541381_li3w.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/111\/0\/10334224\/il_570xN.1088541381_li3w.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/111\/0\/10334224\/il_fullxfull.1088541381_li3w.jpg","full_height":641,"full_width":879},{"listing_image_id":1041987268,"hex_code":"928073","red":146,"green":128,"blue":115,"hue":25,"saturation":21,"brightness":57,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1473681452,"listing_id":250140999,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/135\/0\/10334224\/il_75x75.1041987268_9mre.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/135\/0\/10334224\/il_170x135.1041987268_9mre.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/135\/0\/10334224\/il_570xN.1041987268_9mre.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/135\/0\/10334224\/il_fullxfull.1041987268_9mre.jpg","full_height":647,"full_width":872},{"listing_image_id":842729475,"hex_code":"000000","red":0,"green":0,"blue":0,"hue":0,"saturation":0,"brightness":0,"is_black_and_white":null,"creation_tsz":1443703672,"listing_id":250140999,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/102\/0\/10334224\/il_75x75.842729475_p0m0.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/102\/0\/10334224\/il_170x135.842729475_p0m0.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/102\/0\/10334224\/il_570xN.842729475_p0m0.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/102\/0\/10334224\/il_fullxfull.842729475_p0m0.jpg","full_height":585,"full_width":887},{"listing_image_id":1088541391,"hex_code":"6D4B3A","red":109,"green":75,"blue":58,"hue":20,"saturation":46,"brightness":42,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1473681452,"listing_id":250140999,"rank":4,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/116\/0\/10334224\/il_75x75.1088541391_1gzw.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/116\/0\/10334224\/il_170x135.1088541391_1gzw.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/116\/0\/10334224\/il_570xN.1088541391_1gzw.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/116\/0\/10334224\/il_fullxfull.1088541391_1gzw.jpg","full_height":568,"full_width":890},{"listing_image_id":842769247,"hex_code":"000000","red":0,"green":0,"blue":0,"hue":0,"saturation":0,"brightness":0,"is_black_and_white":null,"creation_tsz":1443708910,"listing_id":250140999,"rank":5,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/101\/0\/10334224\/il_75x75.842769247_ef5p.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/101\/0\/10334224\/il_170x135.842769247_ef5p.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/101\/0\/10334224\/il_570xN.842769247_ef5p.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/101\/0\/10334224\/il_fullxfull.842769247_ef5p.jpg","full_height":715,"full_width":750}],"Shop":{"shop_id":10334224,"shop_name":"JonesInTokyoLeather","user_id":25062784,"creation_tsz":1417355978,"title":"Hand crafted watch straps  and leather items from JonesinTokyoLeather","announcement":"Jones In Tokyo offers classically styled watch straps and leather items.

Thank you.","policy_shipping":"Please watch your Etsy mailbox during the next few days, as I may need to contact you in order to confirm information regarding your order (ex: dates, spelling of names, address, etc.).  Your order WILL NOT SHIP until this information is confirmed.\r\n\r\nOrders placed will be shipped out 3-7 business (M-F, excluding weekends and holidays) days after being paid for. Custom orders may take longer depending on how elaborate they are, but 99% of the time all of my  orders go out within a week. \r\n\r\nMy domestic shipping prices are priority prices, which I am aware is not the cheapest option.  However, the reasons I ship priority within the U.S. is because:\r\n  \r\n1.  Priority packages are passed around a lot less than parcel select (cheaper shipping) which lessens the chance of the glasses getting broken before they reach you.  Even though I have a free replacement policy for broken glass (please see my policy under &quot;refunds&quot; on this), it&#39;s still a bummer to have to wait for a replacement glass to arrive.  I used to ship parcel select in the past to save my customers on shipping cost but no matter how well I protected the glasses in packing materials, I was having far too many issues with them getting broken in transit.  So, I made the decision to only ship priority mail for anything larger than a shot glass.\r\n\r\n2.  During my busy seasons (wedding season and Christmas), my processing time can stretch out to 7 business days which can equal up to 11 days total when including weekends and holidays.  Once the glasses ship, I&#39;d like my customers to not have to wait much longer after that to receive their items.\r\n\r\n3.  You receive your items faster, so if there are any issues (broken glasses, errors, etc) or you would like to order additional glasses, there will be ample time before your wedding date\/holiday\/occasion to do any of that.\r\n\r\n(Please note, shot glasses and shot glass sets of 2 still have the option to ship first glass.)\r\n\r\nNote for International Shipping Rates:\r\nI prefer to ship  everything Priority Mail International.\r\nFirst Class International Mail is less expensive, but there is no tracking, and most packages take about a month or longer to arrive. \r\nIf you wish to purchase First Class shipping instead I can do that, but I must warn you once the package ships I have no way of tracking it at all and there is a higher risk of them getting broken in transit.  I replace all broken glasses for free (please see my policy under &quot;refunds&quot; on this) however, its a bummer to have to wait another month or so for the replacement to arrive.\r\n\r\nProcessing time does not include ship time. If you need your order by a specific date please contact me PRIOR to placing your order to make sure that I am able to meet the deadline.  I also offer Express Overnight Processing that can be added to your order by clicking here:\r\nhttps:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/205754025\/express-processing\r\n\r\nI do not offer Overnight Shipping services.  Please do not select Express Shipping but instead opt for the cheaper alternative of my $9.00 express processing fee which can be purchased here:\r\nhttps:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/205754025\/express-processing\r\n \r\nUNITED STATES: Shipped Via Priority mail usually takes 2-4 days shipping in the US, but is NOT GUARANTEED. If you need an item by a certain date, please contact me prior to purchase for express mail shipping prices. \r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL ORDERS: Shipped via First Class International Mail, Ship time varies based on your location, but can take up to 4-5 weeks to receive.  International Priority service take 10-14 business days.  Please be aware that there may be custom fees that I am not aware of and it is against the law for me to charge them to you before hand OR pay for them on my end.\r\n\r\n**Projected shipping dates are for shipping date only, NOT a guarantee of delivery.

I guarantee FREE replacement of any broken glasses to be sent out the following business day unless I specify otherwise.  A picture of the broken item MUST BE SENT to me and the Affidavit MUST BE completed before a free replacement glass is sent to you.\r\n\r\nErrors:\r\nIf it&#39;s my mistake, I&#39;ll send out a corrected item right away.

Pictures of the design will be sent through the Etsy messaging system until it is perfected for you.  If we can&#39;t decide on a design, your order can be cancelled for a full refund.
